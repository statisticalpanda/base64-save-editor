# Base64 Save Editor

https://statisticalpanda.github.io/base64-save-editor/

Created to simplify incremental save editing.

Paste the save string and click the Decode button to decode the save.

Once a save is loaded, the search field at the top can be used to filter by field name.

Clicking on a header will remove filters and auto-scroll to that section.

Encode & Export button will encode back to base64 and send it to the clipboard.
